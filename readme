- DScope uses the eclipse kepler
- The src code is in the src.tar.gz
- The scripts are in the scripts/
- There is a demo in the Demo_20190423.tar.gz for reference
- Before runing those scripts, you should compile the target Java application, and change some hard-coded variables in the script.
- Jar files are needed, including the target application jars with their dependent lib jars and also the following jars:
  - junit-4.12.jar
  - hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
  - tools.jar
  - rt.jar
  - jce.jar
  - scala-library.jar
- If there are some errors when running dscope code, it is mostly because of the missing jars and the configuration variables in the script are misconfigured.
